          <div id="aboutText">
            <h3>We are a  group of bisexual survivors facilitating peer-lead, <br>
              online support groups for survivors of sexual and/or <br>
              domestic violence/abuse. <br><br>
              We are also advocates for bisexual, pansexual, and other <br>
              non-monosexual (bi+) survivors, working to ensure that <br>
              our voices are heard and our needs met.<br>
            </h3>
          </div>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
          <h3>We run bi-weekly chats via the secure messaging app Telegram. <br><br>
            For each session, we set a theme (such as healing tools, <br>
            finding closure, dealing with flashbacks) as a way of <br>
            shapeing the conversation, but participants are free to discuss <br>
            anything relevant.<br><br>
            Often, people find it very useful and healing just to have a space <br>
            to finally share what happened to them and have others validate <br>
            the pain that it has caused. <br><br>
            Each chat session is moderated by one or more members <br>
            of the BSN team. <br><br>
            The channels are private, which means you need to be invited <br>
            by a link and other people can’t find the chat and join it. <br><br>
            After the session is finished, a moderatore deletes the channel, <br>
            leaving no traces of the discussion.<br><br>
            You are more than welcome to use a screen name when joining <br>
            if you want to be anonymous.
          </h3>

        <h2>Why we do it</h2>
          <h3>Sexual and domestic violence is one of the biggest issues <br>
            facing the bi+ community. <br><br>
            Bi+ women face higher rates of sexual/domestic violence <br>
            than gay and straight women, and report worse experiences <br>
            when seeking help or support. <br>
            Bi+ men also face higher rates of sexual violence than monosexual men.<br><br>
            We are currently the only bi+ specific resource for survivors in the UK.<br><br>
             Many bi+ people don’t feel comfortable using mainstream <br>
             survivor support services because they may have to <br>
             out themselves or experience homophobia/biphobia. <br><br>
             They often do not feel comfortable accessing <br>
             LGBTQIA+ survivor support services because of <br>
             the prevalence of biphobia among the LGBTQIA+ community. <br><br>
             They also, rightfully, do not feel that these resources <br>
             will have the knowledge or understanding of bi+ issues <br>
             necessary to support them. <br><br>
             Part of our advocacy of bi+ survivors is challenging the biphobia <br>
             that leaves bi+ people so vulnerable to sexual/domestic violence,<br>
             and isolates us from support.<br>
